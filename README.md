## Abstract: 
Every May to June, basketball fans all over the world tensely wait for an announcement, National Basketball Association (NBA) final season Most Valuable Player (MVP). It is perceived as the player whose performance is the most prominent over the season, and determined by media associates’ votes. In this project, to predict 2019/2020 final season MVP, we used two approaches, statistical approach that use player performance statistics to perform regression and text-based approach that use tweets of the voters and sentiment analysis. Different machine learning algorithms are applied in our analyses, and parameters are tuned to obtain higher accuracy. Through the project, two hypotheses are tested: 1. Performance statistics can capture player’s value using machine learning methods, 2. Voter’s preferences are reflected in their tweets, and are observed from tweets sentiment.
