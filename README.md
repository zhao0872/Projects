It is perceived as the player whose performance is the most prominent over the season, and determined by media associates’ voting. In this project, to predict 2019/2020 final season MVP, we used two approach- statistical approach that use player performance statistics and text-based approach that use voter’s tweets- to perform regression and sentiment analysis. Different machine learning algorithms are applied in our analysis, and parameters are tuned to obtain higher accuracy.
